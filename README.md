# IEEE-CIS-Fraud-Detection
This project is part of a Kaggle competition to benchmark machine learning models on a challenging large-scale dataset. 

**Problem statement** 

IEEE-CIS has partnered with the worldâ€™s leading payment service company, Vesta Corporation, seeking the best solutions for the fraud prevention industry. The objective of this project is to improve fraud prevention systems in the payment industry to save consumers millions of dollars and improve customer experience,helping hundreds of thousands of businesses reduce their fraud loss and increase their revenue. And of course, to save people the hassle of false positives. Vesta Corporation provided the dataset for this project. Vesta Corporation is the forerunner in guaranteed e-commerce payment solutions. It was founded in 1995, Vesta pioneered the process of fully guaranteed card-not-present (CNP) payment transactions for the telecommunications industry. Since then, Vesta has firmly expanded data science and machine learning capabilities across the globe and solidified its position as the leader in guaranteed ecommerce payments. Today, Vesta guarantees more than $18B in transactions annually.

**Research Question**

The research question is to develop a machine learning model that accurately detects fraudulent card transactions using various transactional and behavioral features. The target variable is whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. The objective is to determine the number of fraudulent transactions and the number of normal transactions in the dataset.
